Right now, I am proud to be a PhD candidate (Expected: December 2018) in the [Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation](https://frec.vt.edu/) department at Virginia Tech with my co-advisors, [Dr. Daniel McLaughlin](https://frec.vt.edu/people/McLaughlin.html), and [Dr. Rob Slesak](https://mn.gov/frc/rob-slesak.html). In the near future, I hope to apply my knowledge and skills to study (and solve!) socioenvironmental problems, both big and small.
